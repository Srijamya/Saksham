# Saksham (MPSTME BTech IT - FYP 2022)

Our project “Saksham” is a Speech & Text based Assistive Application for Special Needs Individuals that can provide assistance to differently-abled users such as deaf- mute individuals or those with learning/language disabilities like dyslexia, dysgraphia in carrying out some of their everyday tasks.

About 2.2% of India’s population lives with some kind of physical or mental disability, as per the National Statistics Office report on disability.
The project goal is to eliminate the need for human assistance and to provide equal opportunities and a more normal way of life to those with language or other disabilities.

# Overview

For many of us we are lucky enough to live our daily life without problems arising when carrying out small, seemingly mundane tasks like reading a report, appearing for a presentation or getting any of our own official paperwork handled; in fact we probably don’t even give it a second thought. But not everyone can say the same and there are so many individuals that might be required to put in a little extra effort from their side for these same jobs.

Individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, or those with speech and/or language disabilities require assistance in daily tasks. Assistive technology is a term for assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for people with such disabilities or the elderly population. People with disabilities often have difficulty performing activities of daily living independently, or even with assistance. Assistive software, also called adaptive software, refers to computer programs designed for specialized hardware used by physically challenged people.

In many situations, especially at school or work, they may have trouble reading documents or communicating with peers. We propose a mobile application which will solve this purpose by providing them with easily usable speech and text conversion features which they can use on their own with no assistance, even while traveling. The following Saksham features will help them overcome social barriers and help them interact with ease, leading to ease of life.

# Features

1. Read Easy: It will open to a scanner which will essentially capture written data and provide a text to speech conversion for users with learning disabilities, e.g. students/adults with dyslexia can use the app to scan and help them with studies or office work, and in special cases even partially visually impaired users may be able to utilise.
2. Listen Freely: It will open to a voice recorder which will be able to record speech and provide a voice to text conversion for users with hearing disabilities, e.g. deaf-mute individuals or partially deaf persons can use the app to easily participate in conversations around them.
3. Speak Easy: It will accept dialogue from users in the form of text and convert it to speech which will help people with speech disability to interact with others, e.g. a vocally challenged person can type out messages which will be read out as voice messages as everyone is not familiar with sign language.
